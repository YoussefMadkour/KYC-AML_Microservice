# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) microservice built with FastAPI. The system simulates real-world fintech workflows using mock providers instead of paid third-party services. It demonstrates microservice architecture, webhook handling, asynchronous processing, and secure backend design suitable for fintech applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fintech platform, I want to onboard new users through a KYC verification process, so that I can comply with regulatory requirements and verify user identities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user submits KYC information THEN the system SHALL create a user record with encrypted sensitive data
2. WHEN KYC data is submitted THEN the system SHALL initiate an asynchronous verification process
3. WHEN verification is initiated THEN the system SHALL return a tracking ID to the client
4. IF required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with specific field requirements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to track KYC verification statuses, so that I can monitor the onboarding pipeline and handle manual reviews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a KYC check is created THEN the system SHALL set initial status to "pending"
2. WHEN verification completes THEN the system SHALL update status to "approved", "manual_review", or "rejected"
3. WHEN status changes occur THEN the system SHALL log all state transitions with timestamps
4. WHEN querying KYC records THEN the system SHALL return current status and verification details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an external KYC provider, I want to send webhook notifications about verification results, so that the platform can update user statuses in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a webhook is received THEN the system SHALL verify the signature for authenticity
2. WHEN a valid webhook is processed THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding KYC record
3. WHEN webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and implement retry logic
4. IF webhook signature is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the request and log security events

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure API access controls, so that only authorized users can access sensitive KYC data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any API endpoint THEN the system SHALL require valid JWT authentication
2. WHEN users have different roles THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access controls
3. WHEN admin users access data THEN the system SHALL allow full CRUD operations
4. WHEN regular users access data THEN the system SHALL restrict access to their own records only

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want asynchronous processing for heavy operations, so that API responses remain fast and the system can handle high loads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN KYC verification is requested THEN the system SHALL queue the task using Celery
2. WHEN background tasks are processed THEN the system SHALL use RabbitMQ as the message broker
3. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL update database records with results
4. WHEN tasks fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want sensitive data to be encrypted at rest, so that personal information is protected even if the database is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing passport numbers THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using field-level encryption
2. WHEN storing other PII data THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate encryption methods
3. WHEN retrieving encrypted data THEN the system SHALL decrypt it transparently for authorized access
4. WHEN encryption keys are managed THEN the system SHALL use secure key management practices

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the entire system to be containerized, so that it can be deployed consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL run all services using Docker containers
2. WHEN starting the stack THEN Docker Compose SHALL orchestrate all required services
3. WHEN services start THEN the system SHALL include PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and the FastAPI application
4. WHEN containers are built THEN the system SHALL use multi-stage builds for optimized image sizes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance team, I want automated testing and CI/CD pipelines, so that code quality is maintained and deployments are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN GitHub Actions SHALL run automated tests
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL perform linting and code quality checks
3. WHEN quality checks pass THEN the system SHALL build and tag Docker images
4. WHEN builds complete THEN the system SHALL provide deployment artifacts

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to check my KYC status and manage my profile, so that I can track my verification progress and update information when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints to view their KYC status
2. WHEN users need to update information THEN the system SHALL allow profile modifications
3. WHEN status is "manual_review" THEN the system SHALL provide clear next steps
4. WHEN verification is complete THEN the system SHALL display approval status and any restrictions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a mock external provider, I want to simulate realistic KYC workflows, so that the system can demonstrate real-world integration patterns without requiring paid services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN KYC checks are initiated THEN mock providers SHALL simulate processing delays
2. WHEN simulating results THEN the system SHALL randomly assign realistic outcomes
3. WHEN sending webhooks THEN mock providers SHALL use proper signature schemes
4. WHEN demonstrating flows THEN the system SHALL cover all major KYC scenarios (approve, reject, manual review)
